# Fix for "Multiple commands produce Info.plist" Error

## Problem
The error occurs because modern Xcode projects automatically generate Info.plist files, and having a manual Info.plist file creates a conflict.

## Solution

### Step 1: Manual Xcode Configuration (Recommended)

Since I've removed the manual Info.plist file, you need to add the Face ID permission directly in Xcode:

1. **Open your project in Xcode**
2. **Select your app target** (FitLifeAdvisorApp)
3. **Go to the "Info" tab**
4. **Under "Custom iOS Target Properties"**, click the **+** button
5. **Add this key-value pair**:
   - **Key**: `Privacy - Face ID Usage Description` (or `NSFaceIDUsageDescription`)
   - **Type**: String  
   - **Value**: `FitLife Advisor uses Face ID to securely authenticate and protect your personal fitness and health data.`

### Step 2: Alternative - Code-based Permission Check

If you prefer to handle this in code, the app will still work, but you'll get a runtime warning. The LocalAuthentication framework will handle the permission request automatically.

### Step 3: Verify the Fix

After adding the Face ID permission in Xcode:

1. **Clean Build Folder** (Cmd+Shift+K)
2. **Build the project** (Cmd+B)
3. **Run on simulator or device**

## Expected Result

- ✅ No more "Multiple commands produce Info.plist" error
- ✅ Face ID authentication will work properly
- ✅ App Store submission will be accepted (Face ID permission is properly declared)

## Notes

- Modern iOS projects (iOS 14+) typically don't use separate Info.plist files
- The Xcode project configuration handles all the necessary plist entries automatically
- Your authentication system code remains unchanged and fully functional

## Troubleshooting

If you still see the error:
1. **Clean Build Folder** (Product → Clean Build Folder)
2. **Delete Derived Data** (Xcode → Preferences → Locations → Derived Data → Delete)
3. **Restart Xcode**
4. **Try building again**
