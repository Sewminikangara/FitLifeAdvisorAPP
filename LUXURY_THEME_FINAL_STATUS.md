## 🔧 **Issues Resolved**

### **1. iOS 16+ Compatibility** ✅
- **Problem**: `toolbarBackground` and `toolbarColorScheme` only available iOS 16+

- **Result**: App now supports iOS 15.6+ with enhanced features on iOS 16+

### **2. SavedMeal Model Structure** ✅
- **Problem**: `meal.nutrition.calories` - SavedMeal has no member 'nutrition'
- **Solution**: Changed to `meal.totalNutrition.calories` to match actual model structure
- **Result**: Meal calorie display now works correctly in activity timeline

### **3. Theme Integration** ✅
- **Problem**: Theme needed to be applied across entire app
- **Solution**: Created comprehensive luxury theme system with central LuxuryTheme.swift
